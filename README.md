 Using Figma Designs
Using Figma designs helped guide my coding process by providing clear visual references for layout, spacing, colors, and typography. It reduced guesswork and allowed me to focus on accurately translating a design into clean HTML and CSS.

Challenges in Matching the Design
The main challenges were achieving precise spacing, font sizing, and alignment, especially when small CSS adjustments caused noticeable visual differences. Ensuring consistency across screen sizes also required careful testing.
